## NoSQL DEFINITION:  
Next Generation Databases mostly addressing some of the points:  
being non-relational, distributed, open-source and horizontally scalable.  
  

The original intention has been modern web-scale databases. The movement began early 2009 and is growing rapidly. Often more characteristics apply such as: schema-free, easy replication support, simple API, eventually consistent / BASE (not ACID), a huge amount of data and more. So the misleading term "nosql" (the community now translates it mostly with "not only sql") should be seen as an alias to something like the definition above.  

- Data Control
- Encryption
- Deployed across availability zones

 In Mongo, we don’t work with tables and rows, we work with collections and documents. Documents contain JSON/BSON hashes, so any data that can be represented as a hash can be stored in Mongo. Mongo is a schemaless database, meaning there’s no requirements nor enforcement about the structure of the data in a document.
