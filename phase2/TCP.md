# TCP
## BASICS
Ftp stands for File Transfer Protocol.
The IP address is used to reach the server, and the PORT tells which path on the system I want to access.
IP is like the street address and the PORT is like the Apartment Number.
The DNS (Domain Name Servers) is the one responsible for translating "google.com" into an IP address to one
of the google machines.

## TCP
The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is how two machines connect with each other, sending and recieving data.
